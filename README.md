# Reflectance Fitting

Mathematica, Matlab, Python (and maybe other languages in the future) for fitting ALS and PMS Reflectance Data.

This is just a place for sharing sourced code. Don't put any binary files here like Mathematica notebooks for figures.

This repository shares Mathematica workspaces (.m files) and Matlab classes and functions (also .m files unfortunately) for fitting data from the advanced light source. The wiki
and the doc directories have documentation on how they are used.
